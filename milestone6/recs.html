                <h2>Ramp</h2>
                <p>
                    For a deck with a sizable number of dragons, I would recommend trying the new Encroaching Dragonstorm from Tarkir Dragonstorm. 
                    Encroaching Dragonstorm is a semi-repeatable piece of land ramp that also costs more than 3 mana, so any Keruga, the Macrosage 
                    companion deck with a dragon emphasis is bound to love this card.

                <h2>Card Advantage</h2>
                <p>
                    Card Advantage typically means drawing cards so you have more in your hand, but that's not the only way you can get card 
                    advantage.
                    Over the Top is a very powerful piece of card advantage in any deck that cares about having a strong board presence.

                <h2>Targeted Disruption</h2>
                <p>
                    In Commander, 99% of the time, the most important permanent on an opponent's board is their own commander. So, targeted 
                    commander removal is always sought after. Swift Reconfiguration, while being an enchantment and therefore only castable at sorcery speed, 
                    makes up for this by effectively turning off an enemy commander for the rest of the game.

                <h2>Mass Disruption</h2>
                <p>
                    Mass Disruption styled effects are ones that typically help to rest the board so that you can catch up to 1 or 2 players 
                    who have started to "run away" with the game. While slower to activate I think that Sheoldred, or more acuretly her backside 
                    The True Scriptures, is a good canadet for this slot in any black deck.
